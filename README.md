## Part I - WeatherPy

In this part a Python script was created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
Your first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modelling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.


### Part II - VacationPy

In this part, we used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.

* A heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework is created.

* the DataFrame was narrowed nown to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
